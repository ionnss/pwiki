Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.
Its subject matter includes the behavior of humans and nonhumans, 
both conscious and unconscious phenomena, 
and mental processes such as thoughts, feelings, and motives.
The word psychology derives from the Greek word psyche, for spirit or soul. 
The latter part of the word psychology derives from -λογία -logia, which means "study" or "research".
In 1890, William James defined psychology as "the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions."
